    excerpt: "
        We enable and accelerate development teams through inspiration, 
        education, tooling and the concept of paved road. The paved road is 
        about defining common processes and configuring common tools that can 
        be reused in different development projects."

        source as much of our work as possible, contribute to other projects
        and share additional information through snippets and blogs."
